# search61b
Inspired by the instant search on [cs61a.org](cs61a.org). I also wanted to try using React on top of Meteor.

Meteor stuff in in `app/`, a MongoDB populator and some scrapers in `utils/`

TODOs:
* Styling results
* Form for crowdsourcing more links
* Form for bug reports and stuff
* Admin console for processing the above things
* More scraping
* Piazza integration?
